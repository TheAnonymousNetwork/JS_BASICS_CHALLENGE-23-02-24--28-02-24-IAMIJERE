//IN DETAILS
/*
 JavaScript is a programming language that enables developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. 
 It is primarily used for client-side scripting in web development, allowing web pages to respond to user actions, modify content dynamically, and interact with the browser.

JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML documents or included as separate files, and it runs directly in the web browser on the client's device. It is a versatile language with a wide range of applications, including creating interactive forms, validating user input, animating elements, handling events, making asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX), and building full-fledged web applications (often using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js).

In essence, JavaScript is a fundamental tool for web developers, enabling them to create dynamic and engaging user experiences on the web.
